## Project Components

### 1. Backend (Django REST API)
- Built with Django and Django REST Framework
- Handles user authentication and management
- Processes plant disease detection using AI models
- Manages user profiles and disease detection history
- Located in `/Backend` directory

### 2. Frontend (React + Vite)
- Modern web interface built with React and Vite
- Responsive design for all devices
- Interactive disease detection interface
- User dashboard for history and management
- Located in `/frontend` directory
